okTube - Help

- How the app works?

  It uses an API called lolyoutube (https://lolyoutube.com). It is free to use and available to anyone.
  
- Why this API and not other that doesn't show ads?

  It is unlimited and, as I said before, free. 
  
- Why the UI is so simple but confusing?

  I tried to make the UI as easy to use but not filled with details. I'm going to improve the UI. Any recommendations to it, open an issue please.
  
- I have another question.
  
  Tell me on Twitter (@reneantoniotg) or with an email (reneantoniodev@gmail.com)
